NOTE ON RELEASES
================

This is a long-term-support (LTS) release of mspgcc.

Quoting from
http://www.mail-archive.com/mspgcc-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg10028.html:

  Certain releases of mspgcc will be marked as "Long Term Support".  These
  releases include well-tested sets of patches against specific versions of
  upstream packages like gcc and binutils.  The maintenance promise for LTS
  releases is that reproducible "significant" bugs for which a
  non-disruptive fixes can be identified will be fixed and patches supplied
  which can be applied on top of the patches provided in the corresponding
  mspgcc release.

  Other releases should be considered development snapshots.  They may be
  based on development (unversioned) snapshots of upstream tools.  No
  official patches will be released for these, and support for them ends on
  the release of the next version of mspgcc.

  Downstream packagers should publish only LTS releases, and should
  periodically check for new patches to be integrated into their packages
  (though I'll try to announce them periodically).  Patches are archived on
  the patches branch of the mspgcc repository, and are published for
  individual download at in Files/Patches on SourceForge.  Such patches will
  also be committed to the release branches on the gcc/binutils/gdb git
  repositories.


BUILD OVERVIEW
==============

Build and install a complete toolchain by building each of the following
tools in order:

  binutils
  gcc
  gdb
  msp430mcu
  msp430-libc

The source for the first three is obtained by applying patches in this
directory to the upstream distributions of the generic tools.  The patches
include information on how to build the distribution.

msp430mcu provides C headers and binutils linker scripts for each of the
over 300 microcontrollers in the MSP430 family.  It is released as an
independent package and can be obtained at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430mcu/msp430mcu-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2

where YYYYMMDD is provided in the file msp430mcu.version in this release.  A
.zip file is available as well.

msp430-libc provides C library routines.  It is released as an independent
package and can be obtained at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430-libc/msp430-libc-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2

where YYYYMMDD is provided in the file msp430-libc.version in this release.  A
.zip file is available as well.

** Please report all problems with this toolchain on the mspgcc bug tracker
   at:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=42303&atid=432701

**WARNING** The documentation portions of this package are in progress, and
  may be out of date in significant ways.
