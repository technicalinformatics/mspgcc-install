Title: mspgcc - Single Line MSP430 Assembler

<H2>Single Line MSP430 Assembler</H2>
<P>You can enter a line of assembler code in the text field below.
The resulting machine code along with data words and the cycle count
is printed.
</P>
<P>Example: "mov #7, R6"
</P>

<form action="/cgi-bin/assemble.py" method="get">
    Input line:<input type="text" name="line" value="">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="assemble">
</form>

<P>Description of output:<br>
The first line is the assembler line that is realy interpreted. This
can be different to the input for emulated instructions.
<UL>
    <LI><code>OPC</code>: 16 bit word for the instruction opcode
    <LI><code>DW</code>: 16 bit data word
    <LI><code>PCREL</code>: 16 bit relative address to the current pos.
                The linker would have to calculate the real address here.
</UL>
When you use labels instead of nummeric values, those show up again in the
output.
</P>

<P>The jump instructions (jxx, e.g. jmp) expect a byte offset, relative
to the current position. Only nummeric offsets are allowed. The linker would
need to calculate the offset when using labels.
</P>

<P>This software uses the constant registers of the MSP. However
the result can differ from other assembers.
</P>

<H2>MSP430 Disassembler</H2>
<P>Here you can disassemble a series of word values. It's the opposite of
the operation above.
</P>
<P>Example: 0x4035 0x0007<BR>
</P>

<form action="/cgi-bin/disassemble.py" method="get">
    Input values:<input type="text" name="values" value="">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="disassemble">
</form>

<P>The input can be hex or dec. If not enough numbers are passed, the output
can contain the string "UNKNOWN". This happens e.g. when an instruction requires
an immediate value but only one value was given.
</P>

<H2>Disclaimer</H2>
<P>And as usual - no warranties that the given information is correct.
Use at your own risk.
