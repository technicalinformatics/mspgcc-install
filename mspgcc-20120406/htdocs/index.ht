<H1>The GCC toolchain for the Texas Instruments MSP430 MCUs</H1>
<P>Here you will find a port of the GCC toolchain for the Texas Instruments
MSP430 family of ultra low power MCUs, This includes the GNU C compiler (GCC),
the assembler and linker (binutils), the debugger (GDB), and some other tools
needed to make a complete development environment for the MSP430. These tools
can be used on Windows, Linux, BSD and most other flavours of Unix. However, the
full debug environment is currently limited to Windows, Linux and BSD.
MSP430 development is no longer limited to Windows!

<P>Here is the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/">project page on SourceForge</A>,
the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42303">download area</a>
and the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=42303">CVS repository</A>.
The <A href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=42303">mailing lists</A>, especially the
mspgcc-users list is a good place for discussions about mspgcc, suggestions, bug reports, ...
The <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/manual/">online manual</a> covers the MSP430
as processor, the gcc extensions of this port and finally build
instructions for those who need to build the toolchain from source.
The <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/faq/">FAQ</a> may be of interest too.

<H2>GCC & Binutils</H2>
<B>NOTE: The current version of gcc to use is mspgcc-3.2.3</B>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Binutils is a collection of command line tools to work with assembler and object files for the MSP430.
They include the <B>msp430-as</B> assembler, the <B>msp430-ld</B> linker and <B>msp430-objcopy</B>, a format
converter (e.g. to create intel-hex files). The assembler mnemonics are compatible with the TI syntax. The
control commands and segment names are in the GNU style. The standard binutils package,
available at <A href="http://sources.redhat.com/binutils">http://sources.redhat.com/binutils</a>,
now contains this MSP430 support.
</P>

<P>From the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) we have ported the <B>C compiler</B> (C++ without libstdc++).
</P><P>GNU C is a full featured compiler:
ANSI C89 compatible, different levels of optimization, inline assembly, interrupt handlers
(incl. "wakeup"), floating point etc.
</P>

<P>A C compiler isn't complete without its library. We provide a basic libc, as well as libgcc and crts. These
libraries contain math, string and other functions along with startup and initialization code. libgcc is
included in the gcc sources. libc and the crt files are a separate package, <B>msp430-libc</b>.</P>

<P>You can download the latest sources from CVS. The procedure is explained
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=42303">here</a>. Also, you can
look in the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42303">
download area</a> for ready made packages.
</P>

<P><A href="contribute.html">Contributions</A>, comments and bug reports are
very welcome. If you can test the tools, let us know of success or failure
(bugs). When you want to extend the libraries or add new features, let us
know. This is an open source project, where everyone can help make the product
better.
