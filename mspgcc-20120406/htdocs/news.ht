  <LI>gcc-3.2.3  (mspgcc/gcc/gcc-3.3)<UL>
	<LI>works,
	<LI>there is some fault with calls to pointers in R1
	<LI>Maybe some very subtle fault with pointers to structures selecting the correct offset.</UL>
  <LI>gcc-3.3.6 (msp-gcc/gcc/gcc-3.4)<UL>
	<LI>compiles ok,
	<LI>makes bigger code, does not seem to use bit instruction for 'and #',
	<LI>includes mods for C++ (could be back ported to gcc-3.2.3 quite easily)
	<LI>there is some fault with calls to pointers in R1.
	<LI>Maybe some very subtle fault with pointers to structures selecting the correct offset.

	<LI>Does have C++ mods
	<LI>Does have newer devices (1471,....)</UL>
  <LI>gcc-4.0.2<UL>
	<LI>can be made to compile with major modifications,
