<H2>Tools</H2>
<A name="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A><!-- ******************************* -->
<P>You've got a compiler, but what now? Here you can find some tools that make
the environment more complete. You can find pyBSL which can communicate with
the MSP430 BootStrapLoader (ROM) in Flash devices.
</P>
<P>JTAG download has finally arrived and is currently beta software!
</P>
<P>A simulator is under development. You can step through your programs before
downloading to a real device.
</P>

<A name="gdbproxy"><H3>The gdbproxy Flash Emulation Tool (FET) interface for msp430-gdb</H3></A><!-- ******************************* -->
<P>gdbproxy is a proxy program which sits between msp430-gdb and the TI Flash
Emulation Tool (FET). The TI FET tool is their JTAG interface, for debugging
the flash based versions of the MSP430. gdbproxy understands the gdb remote
protocol over TCP/IP connections, and it understands how to control an MSP430
via. a FET (and all the other JTAG adapters that are based on the same schematic).
</P>

<P>gdbproxy is based on the gdbproxy 0.7 program which can be found
<A href="http://world.std.com/~qqi/labslave/rproxy.html">here</A>. It was
intended that the MSP430 code just be added to the existing gdbproxy code.
However, the gdbproxy code has now been so heavily modified it looks like
it has forked and thus was given the new name "gdbproxy". Sorry. Forking is
bad.
</P>

<P>Because gdbproxy relies on proprietary code from TI the full source code
cannot be opened at this time. The generic code (i.e. the modified gdbproxy
code, less the MSP430 specific parts) is available from our CVS repository.
You cannot build an MSP430 debugger with that, but we hope it may be useful
to people trying to build similar tools for other processors.
</P>

<P>What we have to offer right now is binary test versions of gdbproxy for
Linux on i386 and Windows. They are being used, perhaps even as you read this,
to debug real MSP430 programs. They support most of the gdb remote protocol.
</P>

<P>For the Linux inclined we offer
<A href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mspgcc/msp430-gdbproxy?download">this binary</A>.
"libhil.so" is needed and available from our CVS repository.
Windows users should use the installer from our 
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42303">downloads section</A>.
Don't forget to install GIVEIO if you're using Windows NT/2k/XP (Don't use on Win95/98/ME):
Remember these are works in progress, but they are doing useful work for us.
The source for HIL.dll can be found in CVS (this part is open source already).
Both parts are also in the installer.
</P>

<P>The following limitations should be noted:

<UL>
<LI>The IAR and Quadravox tools both loose control of the MSP430 at times. 
gdbproxy does too, but it has the benefit that it doesn't seem to dump
core with the same regularity. It should be very hard to loose
control of the target device - only issues related to certain power saving
modes are supposed to do it. This will be investigated, as it is a pain.</LI>

<LI>gdb is a general purpose tool. We need to live with what is does. One odd
thing it does is choose some strange block sizes in which to download code
to the target device. When it uses large blocks, writing to flash is
reasonably fast. When it sends tiny blocks, writing to flash gets slowwww......
Some caching is currently being done, but improvements are needed.</LI>

<LI>It is advisable to put the following in your .gdbinit file:
<CODE><BR><BR>
set remoteaddresssize 64<BR>
set remotetimeout 999999<BR>
</CODE><BR>
to make gdbproxy behave nicely.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The linux version requires access to /dev/parport0. The default 
permissions on many Linux distributions only allow root to do this. Change the
permissions, and all should be well. The Linux binary was build on a RedHat 7.2
machine. The Win32 build was built with mingw32.
</P>

<A name="pyserjtag"></A><!-- ******************************* -->
<H3>pySerJTAG and Serial-JTAG adapter</H3>
<P>pySerJTAG is the PC side software for the Serial-JTAG adapter. The PC software is open and
written in Python. It should run on the same platforms as pyBSL (Win32, Linux, BSD and more
POSIX compatible systems). The command line options are compatible with pyBSL and pyJTAG.
</P>

<P>The hardware design is open. The schematics can be found in the CVS module
"hardware/serialJTAG" (here's a <A href="jtagF14x.pdf">PDF</A> 62kB). A binary of the firmware for this design is here:
<A href="serjtag.zip">serjtag.zip</A> (&lt;10k, beta).

</P>

<P>Why? The parallel port has some drawbacks such as missing OS support for bit banging.
We cannot access every platform that mspgcc users use. Therefore it's impossible to distribute
binaries for all. The Serial-JTAG adapter moves the proprietary code out to that box and
the user software on the PC can be open source.
It will allow us to provide debug features in the near future.

<H3>msp430-jtag</H3>
<P>Software for the parallel JTAG adapter. It works with Flash devices (MSP430F1xx and F4xx):
erase and download new software or upload RAM or Flash data from the device back to the PC.
It uses the parallel port hardware you get with the FET kits, schematics can be found on
TI's site. It also works with the Olimex JTAG adapter.

<H3>msp430simu</H3>
<P>The simulator is under development. Currently it allows single stepping through programms, but
no active peripherals are yet supported (values can be written at any address, but reading has the
same effect as reading from RAM).
</P>
<P>It has a simple GUI with memory and disassembler views, logging
output, as well as a file open dialog to select intel hex files. Or it can be embedded in Python
scripts e.g. for automatic testing, etc.
</P>

<P>Requirements:<UL>
<LI>Python 2.1 or newer</LI>
<LI>wxPython for the GUI only</LI>
